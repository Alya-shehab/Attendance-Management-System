# Attendance Management System

A Java-based console application for managing employee attendance.  
Built during OOP fundamentals coursework — applying classes, objects, inheritance, and role-based logic.  

This project simulates a simple attendance workflow with different user roles and record tracking.


## 🎯 System Features

- ✅ Admin, Manager, and Employee roles  
- ✅ Clock-in / Clock-out system  
- ✅ Leave requests & approval flow  
- ✅ Attendance record storage  
- ✅ Monthly report generation  
- ✅ Basic notifications simulation


## 🧠 Key OOP Concepts Used

| Concept | Applied In |
|--------|------------|
Classes & Objects | Employees, Manager, Admin, Records, System Controller  
Inheritance | Manager & Admin extending base User class  
Polymorphism | Role-specific methods (admin vs manager vs employee)  
Encapsulation | Attributes & methods controlling data access  
Collections | Lists for storing users & attendance logs

## 🗂️ Project Structure


## 🚀 How It Works

- Employees clock in/out  
- Managers view team attendance + approve leaves  
- Admin controls users & generates monthly reports

Console-based UI to focus on logic, not GUI.
